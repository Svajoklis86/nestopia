Nestopia UE vx.xx win32

How to Build:

You should be able to compile using the VS solution.

Notes:
This is the legacy win32 port of Nestopia with a few enhancements
designed to work with Nestopia UE. It is in maintenance mode and
no new features are planned. However, it will be kept alive as long
as it remains the most complete implementation of Nestopia.

Pull requests for new features will still be accepted if anyone
has interest in enhancing this port.
